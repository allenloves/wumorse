The term "impressionism" came from a satirical review from Louis Leroy against Monet's painting "impression, soleil levant" in 1874.  It was a movement driven from the struggle between conventional art academism and new technology of paints that makes painting outside of studio practical.  However, impressionism in music is more influenced by literature rather than paintings. 

**Symbolism Literature**

Here are some identities of Symbolists in literature

*  Emphasis of sensation and the "oneness" of nature.
*  Blur syntax in language.
*  More sonic than visual.
*  Major writers:
	*  Verlaine
	*  Baudelaire
	*  Mallarmé

**Influences of Music Impressionism**

There are several layers of influences to impressionism, such as:

*  Symbolism literature
*  Oriental culture
*  Urge to be different (from Wagner)

# Debussy #

Early Debussy's works are influenced by Chabrier, Fauré, and of course, Wagner.  Debussy went to Bayreuth in 1888 and 1889.  In his Ariettes Oubliées, lots of chromatic chord progressions, 9th chords, dominant chord extensions demonstrated Wagner influences.  Other piece in this period includes Cinq poemes de Charles Baudelaire.

In 1891 Debussy met Satie and started his path to "break away with Wagner".  Also started to be under the influence of "parallelism" from Satie.  Under his influence he start to embrace model elements, parallelism, and artificial scales.  In the mean time, other cultures also has some impact on Debussy's music.  Including Russian musicians such as Rimsky-Korsakov, Spanish folk music, and Oriental contents such as Japan and Java gamelan music.
